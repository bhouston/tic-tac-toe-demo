# Sound Effects

This directory contains sound effects for the tic-tac-toe game:

- `click.mp3` - Sound when a player clicks on a cell
- `win.mp3` - Sound when the player wins
- `lose.mp3` - Sound when the AI wins
- `draw.mp3` - Sound when the game ends in a draw

These sound files should be added here. They can be downloaded from free sound effect libraries like [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) or [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/).

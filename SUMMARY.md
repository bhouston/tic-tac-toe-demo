# Tic Tac Toe Demo - Project Summary

This project is a tic-tac-toe game built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The game allows users to play against an AI opponent with different difficulty levels.

## Features

- **Game Board UI**: A responsive 3x3 grid with proper styling and visual feedback
- **Game State Management**: Tracks the state of the board, current player, and game status
- **AI Opponent**: Implements the Minimax algorithm for optimal AI moves
- **Difficulty Levels**: Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of wins, losses, and draws across games
- **Animations**: Visual feedback for placing markers and winning
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for game actions
- **Persistence**: Game scores and settings are saved in localStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and proper ARIA attributes
